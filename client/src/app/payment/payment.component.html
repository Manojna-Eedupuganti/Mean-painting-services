                and How Much They Cost Per Sq. Ft. In India</strong></h2>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Here are the various kinds of paints that are available in the market. Wall painting
            colours price determines the whole budget of your renovations.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading nitro-offscreen"><strong>Enamel Paint</strong></h3>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Used in high-traffic areas because it lasts a long time, are very easy to clean and
            come in a variety of glossy finishes. They're also waterproof and stainable, and they're widely used on

            emulsion paint is calculated per square foot and begins at Rs 80.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading nitro-offscreen"><strong>Distemper</strong></h3>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Low-priced water-based paint called distemper can cut the painting labour cost per
            square foot in India. The practice of applying this paint is referred to as “whitewashing.” It's inexpensive
            and simple to use, but it doesn't last very long. It is an annual supplementary labour charge for painting
            because it is not washable and fades and flakes off when wet. The cost of distemper paint is Rs 10 per
            square foot.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading nitro-offscreen"><strong>Lustre Paints (oil or water-based)</strong></h3>

            clean. Many variables should be considered with the help of a house painting cost calculator (easily
            available online). If you're moving into your home right away, you shouldn't use this paint because it takes
            a long time to cure and has a strong odour. The price of lustre paint per square foot ranges between Rs 26
            and Rs 30.</p>
